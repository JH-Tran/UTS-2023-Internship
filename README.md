## Question: In business or technical terms describe your understanding of continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)? What are some tools that are used for this and why are they used.

Continuous integration (CI) is the practice of regularly merging code changes into a central repository and running automated builds and tests on the code. This helps teams to detect and fix integration issues quickly, ensuring that the codebase is always in a deployable state (Atlassian, n.d.). Continuous delivery (CD) is an extension of CI, in which the process of releasing code to production is automated. CD enables teams to release code changes to users more frequently, with confidence that the code has been thoroughly tested and is of high quality (Rehkopf, n.d.).

There are many tools available that are used to automate the CI/CD process, such as:
* Jenkins (Jenkins, n.d.): open-source automation server can be customised to be used for building, testing, and deploying to various software environments.
* Travis CI (Travis CI, n.d.): a cloud-based CI platform that integrates with GitHub. Designed to be easy to set up and used and offers a range of features supporting multiple programming languages, ability to run test in parallel, and the option to deploy code to various cloud platforms.
* CircleCI (CircleCl, n.d.): cloud-based CI and CD platform. Offering a wide range of features such as support for containerisation, canary deployments, and blue/green deployments. It is highly scalable being able to be used to set up complex CI/CD piplines.
* GitLab (GitLab, n.d.): CI built-in CI/CD tool within the GitLab platform that allows teams to set up continuous integration and delivery pipelines directly from within the GitLab interface. It offers features such as support for multiple programming languages, the ability to run test parallel, and the option to deploy code to various cloud platform.

The choice of a particular CI/CD tools depends on various factors of the project such as development team size, technology stack being used, the budget available, ease of use, customizability and integration with other tools and platform (G2, n.d.). Ultimately, the choice of CI/CD tool will depend on the needs of the team and the specific context in which it will be used.
